        The island of Fernando de Noronha is located in Pernambuco, in the
        Northeast region of Brazil. <br />Since it's an island, to get to
        Noronha you need to take a direct flight departing from Recife or Natal
        (bigger cities in the north of Brazil). The flight from Brazil mainland
        will take about an hour. Also, it is very important to mention that the
        island has two seasons: the dry season, which runs from August to
        February, and the rainy season, which runs from March to July.
