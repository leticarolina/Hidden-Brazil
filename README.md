### The project
Hiden Brazil is my first authorial project made with the basic principles of HTML and CSS. 
The project itself has the intention to highlight some of my favorite travel spots within Brazil, I found it fun to practice some functions I was learning like Flexbox and transitions together with building an interface related to a topic that I like. The website was created all in index, so only one main page and the relative links to each destination is redirected to Wikipedia.

### Built with

### What I learned

The main things I have learned and practiced on this project are:
1. Flexbox
2. position the background image
3. Create a hover effect 
```css
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;

  background-position: 35%; /*makes the image focal point after 35% to be responsive and focused*/

  .card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.1);
  transition: all 0.6s ease;
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  border: 1px solid #593123;
}
```
